Second, NO: Consent as the basis of authority does not necessarily entail an ongoing right of the entire population to elect a king; consent could be given to a hereditary monarchy without electoral rights, as seen in historical monarchies that claimed popular consent. Third, NO: Statement 1 is a general principle, while Statement 2 is a specific right; entailment requires additional assumptions about mechanisms of consent, and Salmasius's argument shows that even if such a right exists, it must belong to the whole people, but he does not endorse its existence, highlighting that consent does not automatically grant an electoral right.","I am fairly confident that Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 because consent can be interpreted in various ways (e.g., tacit, historical, or representative) that do not imply a right of the entire population to elect a king. However, some interpretations of consent might include such a right, so I am not absolutely certain.",3,NO
