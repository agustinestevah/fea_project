B0067002p,S0070119005p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements originate from completely different historical and thematic contexts: Statement 1 is from a 14th-century treatise on ecclesiastical power, while Statement 2 is from a 17th-century political speech about anti-Catholic legislation. There is no logical connection between the two. 2. The content of the statements addresses distinct issues: Statement 1 discusses the success of prior discourses in addressing civil discord, while Statement 2 concerns a specific legislative omission that worsens a threat. The truth of one does not guarantee the truth of the other. 3. Even if both involve political discord, the causes and solutions are unrelated: Marsilius focuses on clerical ambition, whereas the 1678 speech focuses on exemptions for royal servants in the context of the Popish Plot. No entailment exists.","The statements are clearly unrelated both in topic and context, making it impossible for one to entail the other. I am completely confident in this assessment.",4.0,NO
B0345003p,S0000892003p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements address fundamentally different concepts: Statement 1 concerns political legitimacy and the source of authority (kings confirmed by the people), while Statement 2 concerns legal principles of individual rights (accountability and self-defense against accusations). There is no logical connection such that one entails the other. 2. Even if Statement 1 implies rulers are accountable to the people, it does not entail the specific principle of individual accountability and the right to defend oneself, which applies broadly in legal contexts, not just to rulers. 3. The contexts of the arguments are distinct: Argument 1 is a theoretical/historical argument about monarchy, drawing on biblical examples; Argument 2 is a specific response to an impeachment during the English Civil War, focusing on due process. The principles in Statement 2 are not logically derived from the historical examples in Statement 1.","The statements are clearly about unrelated topics, and there is no logical implication from one to the other, making the assessment straightforward.",4.0,NO
B1185004p,S0019527003p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The two statements address entirely different subjects: Statement 1 discusses the invalidity of papal secular authority based on human reasoning and divine law, while Statement 2 describes a specific administrative procedure for signing dispatches in 17th-century England. There is no shared conceptual framework or logical connection that would allow Statement 1 to imply Statement 2. 2. The historical and cultural contexts are vastly separated: Marsilius of Padua wrote in 1324 during medieval conflicts between empire and papacy, while Sir Edward Grey spoke in 1678 amid the Popish Plot and parliamentary tensions in England. The issues are era-specific and unrelated. 3. The authors' intents diverge completely: Marsilius aims to restrict ecclesiastical power in secular governance, whereas Grey seeks to clarify procedural accountability in a bureaucratic chain of command. Even if both touch on governance principles, Statement 1 contains no information that necessitates the truth of Statement 2.","The statements are from unrelated domains, separated by time, place, and purpose. There is no logical entailment as the truth of Statement 1 does not force the truth of Statement 2.",4.0,NO
B0214006p,B0439011p,"NO, NO, NO","First, Statement 1 focuses on the legal and moral accountability of kings to the same laws as others, while Statement 2 is about the tactical use of rewards in governance; there is no direct logical connection between these concepts. Second, the arguments come from different authors and contexts: Sidney argues against arbitrary rule and for the binding nature of oaths, whereas Bodin discusses practical strategies for maintaining monarchical power through rewards; their premises do not overlap. Third, entailment requires that if Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 must be true, but even if kings are subject to laws, it does not logically follow that they must use rewards as a strategic tool, as governance can involve other methods.","The statements are derived from separate arguments with distinct themes, and no implicit or explicit link suggests that one entails the other. Therefore, I am completely confident in my assessment.",4.0,NO
B0289003p,S0051842008p,"NO, YES, NO","1. NO: Statement 1 focuses on the human flaws of power holders, while Statement 2 addresses systemic legitimacy through participation; no direct logical entailment exists as per the arguments, where Sidney's solution is delegation to judges/juries, not broad participation. 2. YES: If individuals in power are prone to vices (Statement 1), then to prevent injustice and ensure legitimacy, the system must involve active participation of all members (Statement 2), as implied by both arguments' emphasis on collective processes. 3. NO: The historical and contextual differences between Argument 1 (constitutional monarchy) and Argument 2 (Protectorate politics) mean that Statement 1, derived from one discourse, does not necessarily entail Statement 2 from another distinct discourse.","I am fairly confident because the statements are conceptually distinct, and entailment requires a stronger logical connection; however, political theory might allow for interpretive links, reducing absolute certainty.",3.0,NO
B0868003p,S0053578003p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements are from distinct historical contexts and topics: Statement 1 is a general claim about the origin of legal authority, while Statement 2 is a specific observation about 17th-century England; thus, no logical entailment exists. 2. Statement 1 describes a historical process that can occur in both stable and unstable political conditions; the transfer of authority does not necessitate a tumultuous climate, so it does not entail Statement 2. 3. Even considering the arguments, the authors' perspectives and time periods are unrelated; Ockham's philosophical point about law-making authority has no bearing on the specific political turmoil in Cromwell's England.","The statements are logically independent; the truth of Statement 1 in no way implies the truth of Statement 2, regardless of context.",4.0,NO
B0547001sc,S0019732001sc,"NO, NO, NO","1. Statement 1 is a general philosophical assertion about the necessity of a king for social order, derived from natural law theory, while Statement 2 is a specific policy demand in a particular historical crisis (the Popish Plot). The general principle does not logically imply the specific action. 2. Statement 1 focuses on the king's role in directing the common good and preventing communal dispersion, but it does not address threats to the king's safety or prescribe any protective measures. Therefore, Statement 1 lacks the content needed to necessitate the action in Statement 2. 3. Even if protecting the king were implied by Statement 1, Statement 2 asserts the essentiality of a particular method (searching inns). Alternative means of protection could exist, so the necessity of that specific action is not entailed by the general necessity of a king.","I am completely sure because Statement 1 and Statement 2 operate at different levels of abstraction and specificity. There is no logical connection such that the truth of Statement 1 forces the truth of Statement 2, even when considering historical context and author perspectives.",4.0,NO
B0297009p,S0023013002p,"NO, NO, NO","Reason 1: Statement 1 is a philosophical assertion about liberty and governance, while Statement 2 is a factual claim about political conditions in specific regions. There is no logical connection that would make Statement 2 a necessary consequence of Statement 1. Reason 2: The arguments derive from distinct contexts—Argument 1 is a general critique of absolutism, while Argument 2 addresses immediate post-revolution crises. Thus, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. Reason 3: Entailment requires that the truth of Statement 1 guarantees the truth of Statement 2, but one can accept the value of liberty (Statement 1) without Ireland being in disorder or Scotland discontent (Statement 2), as they are independent facts.",I am completely sure because the statements are unrelated in content and context; no inference or implication exists from one to the other.,4.0,NO
B0688006p,S0017767002p,"NO, NO, NO","Reason 1: Statement 1 is a normative principle about the purpose of governance (promoting common utility), while Statement 2 is a descriptive claim about specific constitutional powers. Normative ends do not logically entail specific institutional means; a ruler could pursue common utility without possessing the particular authority to adjourn, prorogue, or dissolve legislatures.
Reason 2: The historical and theoretical contexts are vastly different. John of Salisbury's medieval concept of a prince (1159) emphasizes submission to divine and natural law, whereas the 1678 English context involves a constitutional monarchy with specific parliamentary procedures. The authority mentioned in Statement 2 emerged from unique historical developments, not from the abstract principle in Statement 1.
Reason 3: The scope of Statement 1 is general and could be satisfied through various governance structures, while Statement 2 identifies a specific prerogative. Entailment would require that promoting common utility necessarily includes this specific power, but many systems achieve common utility without it, demonstrating a lack of logical necessity.",The statements are logically and contextually independent; no direct or necessary connection exists between the normative principle and the specific constitutional power.,4.0,NO
B0171002p,B1002006p,"NO, NO, NO","1. Statement 1 is a normative claim about the source of political authority (consent), while Statement 2 is a descriptive historical claim about the failure of a specific government; there is no logical necessity linking the two. 2. The truth of Statement 1 does not imply the truth of Statement 2, as one could consistently believe that authority derives from consent while also believing that Sparta's failure was due to factors unrelated to virtue or the common good. 3. The authors' perspectives and contexts differ significantly: Sidney focuses on the origin of governmental power, whereas Aristotle addresses the aims of education and the state; thus, the statements operate in separate philosophical domains.","The statements are logically independent and address distinct aspects of political theory, making entailment highly unlikely.",4.0,NO
B0656005p,S0019438001p,"NO, NO, NO","1. Statement 1 concerns internal rebellion due to a prince's own tyrannical actions, while Statement 2 focuses on external threats from a religious group (Papists); the subjects and sources of danger are logically distinct. 2. Statement 1 is a descriptive historical observation about consequences of abuse, whereas Statement 2 is a prescriptive call for preventive action; they serve different logical functions and do not imply one another. 3. The contexts of the arguments differ fundamentally: Argument 1 debates tyrannicide and prince accountability, while Argument 2 addresses a specific conspiracy against the king; thus, the derived statements lack shared premises that would create entailment.","The statements address separate scenarios—one internal and reactive, the other external and proactive—with no logical necessity connecting them. The historical and thematic differences further support the lack of entailment.",4.0,NO
B0607001sc,B1089003sc,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements originate from distinct philosophical frameworks: Statement 1 derives from Suárez's theological argument about Christian liberty within Catholic doctrine, while Statement 2 derives from Hobbes's secular social contract theory. There is no necessary logical connection between the two. 2. Statement 1 concerns the relationship between Christians and civil authority, asserting that Christian liberty does not exempt believers from obedience to just laws. It does not imply any specific duties of the sovereign, such as protecting the Commonwealth's well-being. 3. Even if Christian liberty implies some constraints on sovereign power (e.g., requiring just governance), it does not entail the specific, comprehensive duty outlined by Hobbes, which includes making good laws, applying punishments and rewards, and ensuring safety—all grounded in natural law, not Christian theology.","The arguments are from different contexts and intellectual traditions, making direct entailment unlikely.

Statement 1 concerns the Church's spiritual authority derived from divine intervention, while Statement 2 concerns the secular administrative authority of the Publick Council; these are distinct domains with no logical implication. 2. The historical contexts are separated by centuries and different political systems; the truth of one does not necessitate the truth of the other. 3. The author presents these as separate examples of different sources of political legitimacy; there is no indication in the arguments that one entails the other.",The statements are clearly about different subjects and there is no logical or contextual connection that would make Statement 1 entail Statement 2.,4.0,NO
B1194003p,S0022919005p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements originate from different historical and philosophical contexts: Statement 1 is a theoretical claim about aristocracy from 16th-century religious philosophy, while Statement 2 is a practical assertion about parliamentary procedure in 17th-century England. There is no logical connection that would allow one to entail the other. 2. Aristocracy, as described in Statement 1, involves power distribution among a small ruling group for mutual oversight, whereas a Grand Committee is a specific legislative body within a constitutional monarchy. The concept of aristocracy does not necessitate the existence of such committees. 3. Even considering the principle of collective decision-making, Statement 1 focuses on executive oversight among rulers, while Statement 2 addresses a legislative process for revenue. The truth of Statement 1 does not guarantee the truth of Statement 2.","The statements are conceptually distinct and arise from unrelated arguments; therefore, no entailment exists.",4.0,NO
B0978006p,S0020363004p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements are about completely different historical contexts and issues: Statement 1 concerns a medieval French succession dispute (preference based on gender and foreignness), while Statement 2 concerns a 17th-century English religious-political crisis (focus on implications of a Catholic heir). There is no logical connection such that the truth of Statement 1 guarantees the truth of Statement 2. 2. The truth conditions of Statement 1 do not include any element related to religious succession or the necessity of focusing on implications. Even if the nobles prefer Philip over Blanch, it does not imply anything about the essentiality of focusing on a Catholic heir's implications. 3. From the authors' perspectives, Hotoman's account criticizes female and foreign rule, while Grey's speech emphasizes Protestant concerns. Although both involve ruler suitability, the specific necessity in Statement 2 is not entailed by the preference in Statement 1, as the reasons and contexts are disparate.","I am completely sure because the statements are logically independent, addressing unrelated topics in different historical periods, and no plausible inference connects them.",4.0,NO
B0936003p,S0023127003p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements originate from entirely different historical and political contexts: Statement 1 describes an ancient Francogallian practice, while Statement 2 addresses post-Glorious Revolution England. There is no logical connection that would make the truth of Statement 1 necessitate the truth of Statement 2. 2. Statement 1 focuses on ceremonial consultation and receiving homage/gifts, which does not inherently imply specific policy priorities like military provisioning. Even if public affairs were discussed, the necessity of providing for the Ordnance, Army, and Fleet is not a logical consequence. 3. The authors' perspectives differ: Hotoman emphasizes limiting royal power through popular assemblies to prevent tyranny, while the speaker in Argument 2 focuses on securing the new monarchy through practical measures like military funding. These differing aims mean the premises of one do not entail the conclusions of the other.","The statements are clearly from different contexts and address distinct aspects of governance.

B0153008p,B0303001p,"NO, NO, NO","1. Logical independence: Statement 1 is a general principle about violent regimes undermining justice, while Statement 2 is a specific claim about English liberty. The truth of one does not logically guarantee the truth of the other. 2. Contingency: Even if violent regimes are harmful, it does not entail that England uniquely possesses a right to liberty; that depends on historical and legal factors not implied by Statement 1. 3. Possibility of falsity: Statement 1 could be true even if Statement 2 were false (e.g., if England lacked such a right), demonstrating no necessary connection.","The statements address distinct aspects of political theory with no direct logical implication.

Logical disconnect: Statement 1 concerns the procedural legitimacy of punishment under usurped power, while Statement 2 addresses human behavior regarding societal change. No logical implication exists between these distinct concepts. 2. Contextual separation: Statement 1 derives from a philosophical argument on political authority (Hobbes), and Statement 2 from a practical call for legislative action (Grey's speech). Their disparate contexts prevent entailment. 3. Lack of causal or necessary link: The truth of Statement 1 does not force the truth of Statement 2; usurped powers lacking prior judgment does not necessitate individual passivity or reliance on divine intervention.","The statements are from unrelated domains with no logical, causal, or contextual connection, making entailment impossible.

The statements originate from distinct historical contexts (16th-century Holy Roman Empire vs. 17th-century England) and address different political issues, so there is no logical implication from one to the other. 2. Statement 1 describes a potential argument about sovereignty, while Statement 2 prescribes a method to resolve doubts; the truth of the former does not necessitate the truth of the latter. 3. The authors' perspectives are analytical (Bodin) versus practical (Grey), and the content of the statements does not share common elements that would support entailment.","The two statements are entirely independent in terms of subject matter, context, and logical content.

Historical: The arguments derive from different years (1651 vs. 1657) and address distinct historical circumstances; the principle that the king must call Parliament does not imply Scotland's fragile state in 1657, as the latter results from events post-dating Milton's argument. 3. Perspective: Milton's argument focuses on limiting royal power and emphasizes popular sovereignty, with no reference to Scotland's situation; the speaker in Argument 2 is concerned with immediate political stability and institutional legitimacy; the truth of Statement 1 from one author's viewpoint does not entail Statement 2 from another's.",The lack of entailment is clear both logically and contextually; the statements address unrelated subjects and are grounded in different historical moments.,4.0,NO
B0888003sc,S0018986002sc,"NO, NO, NO","1. Logical analysis: Statement 1 expresses a purpose (ensuring state well-being) and Statement 2 expresses a cause (economic constraints). There is no direct logical implication between a goal and a specific cause; thus, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. 2. Contextual analysis: Argument 1, from Bossuet (1709), focuses on religion and justice as foundations of state well-being, with no mention of economic constraints. Argument 2, from a 1678 English parliamentary speech, addresses fiscal limitations in a specific political climate. The differing contexts and author perspectives show no entailment. 3. Conceptual analysis: State well-being encompasses multiple dimensions (political, moral, economic). Economic constraints may be a factor to manage, but they are not a necessary condition or implied reason for pursuing state well-being; thus, entailment does not hold.","The statements are derived from unrelated arguments with distinct goals and contexts, making any entailment logically unsupported.

B0787006p,S0024324005p,"NO, NO, NO","1. The statements address distinct historical contexts and subjects: Statement 1 concerns the representativeness of bishops in the House of Lords in 1651, while Statement 2 addresses financial accountability and military progress in 1689. There is no logical connection such that the truth of one forces the truth of the other. 2. The authors' perspectives differ fundamentally: Milton argues against ecclesiastical influence in government, while the 1689 speaker emphasizes parliamentary cooperation with the monarchy. These disparate concerns do not create an entailment relationship. 3. Even if both statements relate to governmental reform, Statement 1 does not provide premises that necessarily lead to Statement 2. One can accept that bishops were unrepresentative without being compelled to acknowledge specific naval expenditures or Irish military transformations.","The statements are clearly unrelated in content, context, and logical implications, making the lack of entailment certain.",4.0,NO
B1210004p,S0080012003p,"NO, NO, NO","1. Logical analysis: Statement 1 is a descriptive claim about historical warnings that subjects will endure tyranny, while Statement 2 is a normative judgment that a specific king's actions void his trust. There is no logical implication because Statement 1 does not mention conditions under which a king ceases to fulfill his duties, nor does it entail any consequences for the king's legitimacy. 2. Contextual analysis: Argument 1 (Calvin) advocates unconditional obedience to kings, even tyrants, based on divine appointment. Thus, Statement 1, derived from this argument, actually supports enduring tyranny rather than justifying resistance or loss of trust. In contrast, Argument 2 (Glorious Revolution perspective) holds that kings who undermine rights break their trust. Hence, the contexts show opposing premises, and Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. 3. Philosophical background: Calvin's divine right theory does not condition kingship on a trust with the people; authority comes from God alone. Statement 2 reflects a contractarian view where authority is conditional on protecting subjects. Since Statement 1 lacks any notion of a breach of trust, it cannot entail Statement 2.","The lack of entailment is clear from logical, contextual, and philosophical perspectives. The statements come from fundamentally different doctrines about political obligation, and there is no direct logical connection between the descriptive observation of tyranny and the normative claim about breach of trust.",4.0,NO

Logically, Statement 1 does not necessitate Statement 2; the risk of people following unknown leaders could be addressed by other means such as propaganda or coercion. 2. In the context of political stability, the danger of popular demagogues makes it essential for laws to align with collective interests to maintain loyalty and prevent rebellion. 3. From the authors' perspectives, Hobbes (source of Statement 1) advocates absolute sovereignty and obedience to the sovereign's laws, not alignment with passions, so his view does not entail Spinoza's prescription.","I am moderately confident because while there is a practical connection between the statements, logical entailment is not strict, and the authors' philosophical approaches differ significantly.",3.0,NO

Different mechanisms and goals: The agrarian law works by distributing land and enabling broad electoral participation, whereas safeguarding the constitutional monarchy relies on religious restrictions in royal inheritance. There is no causal or logical connection between these distinct mechanisms. 3. Authors' perspectives diverge: Harrington (Argument 1) promotes a republican system where power resides with the many, while the speaker in Argument 2 (post-Glorious Revolution) aims to preserve a Protestant constitutional monarchy. Their objectives are incompatible for entailment, as one does not guarantee the other.","I am completely confident because the statements are derived from unrelated arguments, contexts, and political theories.

Different domains of governance: S1 addresses the judicial function of the monarch, arguing against personal judgment in legal matters. S2 addresses the legislative/executive authority of Parliament and the risk of its irrelevance. These are separate branches; a flaw in one does not necessarily entail the specific outcome in the other. 3. Historical and contextual disparity: The arguments come from different periods and concerns—Argument 1 is a philosophical critique of royal judicial power, while Argument 2 is a pragmatic defense of parliamentary sovereignty. Although both authors may oppose absolutism, the specific statements do not create a logical entailment; S1 could be true without S2 being necessarily true.","Confidence is high because entailment requires logical necessity, and Statement 1 does not mention or imply the conditional about Parliament's autonomy and chaos.

The truth of a general principle does not logically entail a specific historical contingency. 2. NO: Statement 1 describes a conditional scenario (absence of civil society leads to chaos), whereas Statement 2 addresses an action within an existing civil society (rejecting petitions). The conditions differ, so there is no direct logical implication from one to the other. 3.

Logical independence: Statement 1 discusses the role of councils in ensuring accountability of public administrators, while Statement 2 addresses the risk of compromising a bill's purpose through amendments. There is no direct logical implication between these two distinct concepts. 2. Contextual disparity: The arguments stem from different historical contexts and authorial perspectives. Althusius' theoretical framework on commonwealth governance does not directly entail the specific legislative concerns expressed by Grey during the Exclusion Crisis in England. 3. Possibility of counterexample: One can imagine a scenario where councils effectively ensure accountability (Statement 1 true) yet amendments to a bill do not risk compromising its essential elements (Statement 2 false), such as when amendments are carefully deliberated and improve the bill.

B0681001sc,S0022782002sc,"NO, NO, YES","1. NO: In Argument 1, safeguards against tyranny focus on constraining executive power through careful selection of the ruler, institutional design, and divine recourse, without reference to legislative processes. Evidence: Aquinas discusses 'a scheme should be carefully worked out' to prevent tyranny but does not mention parliamentary integrity. 2. NO: The historical and conceptual contexts are distinct; Aquinas's 13th-century monarchy emphasizes virtuous rulership and divine intervention, while Argument 2's 17th-century constitutional monarchy centers on parliamentary authority.

Contextual analysis: In Argument 1, punishing instigators is framed as a prudent and necessary measure for stable governance, with emphasis on balancing severity and clemency. Argument 2, however, arises from a specific historical fear of unchecked power during the Popish Plot, warning against tyranny. The different contexts and aims show no entailment. 3. Authorial perspective: Juan de Mariana writes as a political advisor advocating for virtuous princely rule, assuming accountability to higher laws.

Filmer's denial of natural freedom directly supports the idea that subjects lack the authority to judge kings, which is exactly what Salmasius argues. Thus, Statement 1 entails Statement 2 within the shared context of defending absolute monarchy. 3. NO: The statements are from different contexts; Statement 1 is a philosophical claim about the natural condition of mankind, while Statement 2 is a legal and procedural claim about a specific act. The truth of Statement 1 does not necessarily guarantee the truth of Statement 2, as one could believe all men are born slaves but still allow for exceptional cases where a king can be judged (e.g., if he violates divine law). Moreover, there is no direct logical implication between the two statements.","While the statements are ideologically aligned in supporting absolute monarchy, logical entailment requires that the truth of Statement 1 guarantees the truth of Statement 2.

Bodin states that the power to make law is the first attribute of sovereignty and cannot be shared, while Salmasius emphasizes that parliamentary acts require the king's consent to have force. Reason 2: NO, because Statement 1 is a general principle about sovereignty that could apply to any sovereign entity, not necessarily a king. It is possible for sovereignty to reside in a collective body (like Parliament) without a king, so Statement 1 does not logically entail the specific requirement of a king's approval. Reason 3: YES, because within the specific historical contexts of absolute monarchy defended by both authors, Bodin's concept of sovereignty as incommunicable directly supports Salmasius's claim that the king's approval is necessary for laws to be valid, making Statement 1 entail Statement 2 in this framework.","I am fairly confident because both authors emphasize the absolute authority of the monarch, and within the shared context of absolute monarchy, the indivisibility of sovereignty implies the necessity of royal assent for laws.

Statement 1 specifically emphasizes submission to kings as human ordinances, whereas Statement 2 refers to laws of the commonwealth, which may not be monarchical. The scope of 'human ordinances' may not encompass all laws if the commonwealth is not ruled by a king, so Statement 1 does not logically imply Statement 2. 3. Historically, Salmasius and Spinoza represent conflicting views on political authority: Salmasius argues for absolute obedience to monarchs, while Spinoza argues for obedience to a commonwealth that derives power from the people.

Evidence: Argument 1 discusses legislative power in abstract terms, with no mention of the Prince's Declaration or the Glorious Revolution context.

Reason 2: Even if the Prince's Declaration advocates legislative supremacy, Statement 1 alone provides no information about the Prince's Declaration. Therefore, one cannot deduce Statement 2 from Statement 1 without additional premises linking the two. Evidence: Statement 2 explicitly references 'the Prince's Declaration,' which is not mentioned in Argument 1 or Statement 1.

Reason 3: The contexts of the two arguments are vastly different in time and purpose. Context 1 (Marsilius of Padua, 1324) focuses on the subordination of clergy to secular princes, while Context 2 (1689 England) addresses post-revolution accountability and religious toleration.

The transformation of the king into a subordinate figure (Statement 1) is presented as an absurd consequence that violates the divine order, which Scripture explicitly upholds (Statement 2). Therefore, in this context, Statement 1 entails Statement 2. 3. NO: The two statements are drawn from separate chapters and are part of different lines of reasoning. Statement 1 comes from an argument focusing on the distinction between kings and magistrates, while Statement 2 comes from an argument about the scriptural basis for obedience to sovereigns.

Argument 2: 'the authority granted to a dictator arose from the legal framework established by the people, ensuring that the sovereignty remained with them.' 2.

Thus, no strict entailment. 2. Contextual analysis: Within the historical setting of Argument 2 (post-Glorious Revolution England), the fear of French absolutism and the desire for a constitutional monarchy align with the idea that an accountable executive (Statement 1) must be chosen by the people, not imposed by a foreign power. In this specific context, Statement 1 supports and entails Statement 2. 3. Authorial perspective: Both Marsilius of Padua (Context 1) and the speaker in Argument 2 emphasize that legitimate authority derives from the community. Marsilius argues for secular supremacy over all individuals, including clergy, while Grey stresses the original contract between ruler and people. From this shared viewpoint, if the executive is accountable to the community (Statement 1), then the community must control succession, precluding reliance on foreign powers. Hence, Statement 1 entails Statement 2.","The connection between the statements is contextually and thematically plausible, but logical entailment requires necessity that is not present due to the generality of Statement 1 and the specificity of Statement 2.

Accountability necessarily requires being held to the same standards of justice as any individual, otherwise the consent would be meaningless. This is supported by Sidney's argument that obedience is measured by the General Law, which applies equally. 2. Historical and philosophical context: Both authors write within the early modern resistance theory tradition, which holds that governments exist for the welfare of the people and that rulers are not above the law. Sidney's emphasis on consent leads directly to the conclusion that rulers who violate the law forfeit legitimacy, aligning with Brutus's claim that kings must be held accountable like any individual. 3. Conceptual linkage: Consent-based authority is conditional; the people consent on the understanding that the magistrate upholds justice. If he fails, he becomes an ordinary person subject to ordinary standards.

Sidney links unchecked power to civil strife, and Argument 2 ties accountability to stability, so Statement 1 contextually entails Statement 2. 3.

Logical analysis: Statement 1 asserts a necessary condition for justice (enforcement mechanism), while Statement 2 asserts a necessary condition for preventing tyranny (legal protections). The truth of Statement 1 does not guarantee the truth of Statement 2, as one can conceive of a coercive power that enforces covenants but is tyrannical, thus making legal protections unnecessary for justice but still relevant for tyranny. 2. Historical context: Argument 1 (Hobbes, 1651) emerges from the English Civil War and advocates for absolute sovereignty to end the state of war. Argument 2 (1689 speech) arises after the Glorious Revolution and seeks to limit sovereign power through legal protections. The different contexts indicate divergent concerns; the need for coercive power does not inherently imply the need for constraints on that power. 3. Author's perspective: Hobbes, in Leviathan, argues for an absolute sovereign to enforce covenants and create justice. He would likely see legal protections that limit the sovereign as undermining the coercive power necessary for justice. Thus, from Hobbes' viewpoint, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.","I am highly confident because the two statements address distinct theoretical issues: the foundation of justice versus the prevention of tyranny.

Second answer NO: The historical contexts and authorial perspectives are distinct; Marsilius of Padua writes in a medieval theological-political context about church-state relations, while the 1677 speech addresses early modern parliamentary politics and grievances. The different frames of reference prevent a direct entailment. Third answer YES: Both statements share an underlying principle that legitimate governance is conditional on serving the common good. Statement 1's condition that authority can be rescinded when it fails the common good entails that neglecting the people's concerns (a failure to serve the common good) undermines legitimacy, which is Statement 2's claim.","While there is a thematic connection via the common good, the entailment is not logically necessary because Statement 1 is too specific and the contexts are different.

Argument 2 explicitly calls for Parliament to prioritize the people's will. Thus, accepting Statement 1 (prioritizing non-violent approaches) logically leads to supporting Statement 2 in these contexts, as non-violent correction requires channeling popular sovereignty through representative institutions like Parliament. 2. NO: Statement 1 and Statement 2 address fundamentally different issues. Statement 1 is a methodological principle about avoiding violence when addressing tyranny, while Statement 2 is a substantive claim about which institutional body's decisions should prevail. One can consistently advocate for non-violent conflict resolution (e.g., dialogue, legal processes) without believing that Parliament should prioritize the people's will over other considerations, such as the rights of the Lords or constitutional balances. The contexts differ: one deals with monarchical tyranny, the other with intra-parliamentary conflict, so the principles do not necessarily translate. 3. NO: Logical entailment requires that Statement 1 being true forces Statement 2 to be true in all possible scenarios. However, it is conceivable to prioritize non-violent approaches while not prioritizing the people's will—for example, a ruler might use non-violent propaganda to manipulate public opinion or suppress dissent without genuinely respecting popular sovereignty.

Thus, Statement 1 entails Statement 2.
2. NO: Statement 1 is a descriptive classification of sovereign forms, while Statement 2 is a normative claim about individual rights. There is no strict logical necessity that the classification implies anything about private judgment; one could accept Statement 1 while rejecting Statement 2, for instance by believing that sovereignty can take one of those forms but individuals retain natural rights to moral judgment. Therefore, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.
3. YES: Both statements stem from the same foundational principle in Leviathan: the need for an undivided sovereign to ensure peace and avoid the state of war. Argument 1 establishes that sovereignty is indivisible and only three forms exist. Argument 2 identifies private judgment as a doctrine that divides sovereignty and leads to dissolution. Thus, if sovereignty is as described in Statement 1, it must exclude private judgment as in Statement 2 to maintain indivisibility, making Statement 1 entail Statement 2.","I am fairly confident because within Hobbes' unified theory, the classification of sovereignty implies the sovereign's exclusive right to judge good and evil, but there is a slight ambiguity in strict logical entailment without additional premises.",3.0,YES

From Sidney's perspective, both statements derive from the principle of popular sovereignty: rejecting non-consensual legitimacy (Statement 1) implies that legitimate rule must be based on consent, which inherently subjects the ruler to laws made by the people, as stated in Argument 2. Evidence: Argument 1 asserts governance is based on consent, and Argument 2 cites Bracton that the king is under the law. 2. Historically, early modern republican thought linked the rejection of legitimacy via force or inheritance with the rule of law. Denying such bases of power supports the idea that rulers are bound by law, as tyranny (rejected in Statement 1) is defined by lawlessness. Evidence: Sidney connects tyranny to lack of consent in Argument 1 and justice to law in Argument 2. 3. Logically, Statement 1 only negates specific grounds for legitimacy without affirming a positive basis. It is possible to reject succession, conquest, and usurpation while still holding that a king could be legitimate through divine right and above the law, so Statement 1 does not strictly entail Statement 2.

Even if the nobility weakened, it does not entail that parliamentary officers will act in a threatening manner. 3. NO: From the authors' perspectives, the concerns, while both relate to threats against balanced government, are not equivalent. Sidney focuses on the subversion of original principles via the nobility's decline, while Grey emphasizes defense of parliamentary privilege against executive overreach.

B0197009p,B0430001p,"NO, NO, YES","Answer 1: NO. Statement 1 emphasizes that a king's legitimacy is derived from adherence to the law, which in Sidney's argument means the king is subject to legal constraints. This does not entail discretionary power in appointments; instead, it may require following legal procedures without personal discretion. Evidence from Argument 1 shows that 'the King is under the Law' and 'Law makes the King,' suggesting that any power must be defined by law, not necessarily granting discretion. Answer 2: NO. Statement 2 is based on Bodin's practical governance concerns for preventing revolutions, which is rooted in political prudence rather than legal legitimacy. While discretion in appointments may aid stability, it is not logically entailed by the need for legal adherence for legitimacy. In fact, adherence to law might restrict such discretion if the law specifies appointment methods. Answer 3: YES. If the law that confers legitimacy also grants the king discretionary powers in appointments, then maintaining legitimacy through adherence to that law necessarily involves exercising such discretion. From Bodin's context, the king lays down general rules but can depart from them, indicating that discretion can be part of the legal framework, so in that specific case, Statement 1 entails Statement 2.","I am quite confident but not absolutely sure because entailment can be context-dependent.

(NO) Within their respective arguments, Statement 1 is derived from Sidney's critique of royal dominion over land, emphasizing that kings cannot grant what they do not own. Statement 2 arises from a political speech focused on accountability and the King's Declaration post-Glorious Revolution. While both challenge arbitrary power, Statement 1 does not entail the specific criteria about motions and the King's Declaration in Statement 2. 3. (YES) Historically, both statements emerge from late 17th-century England, where limits on royal authority were central. Sidney's principle that kings must prove ownership (Statement 1) aligns with Whig ideas that influenced the Glorious Revolution, which established constitutional monarchy. Statement 2's emphasis on justice and the King's Declaration (likely the Declaration of Rights) reflects a similar commitment to legitimate governance.

Thus, no direct logical entailment exists.

Therefore, legislative supremacy implies that the King is bound by law, and Statement 2 reflects this implication as the King emphasizes his commitment to acting within legal bounds, showing a conceptual entailment in Locke's framework.
3. Examining the historical and political context, Argument 2 presents the King's emphasis on legality as a strategic move to secure parliamentary support during a volatile period. This emphasis is not a necessary consequence of legislative supremacy but a situational response, so Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 in practice.","I am fairly confident because, although the contexts are related and Locke's theory supports the idea of the King being bound by law, entailment is a strict logical relationship.

Contextual analysis: In Argument 1, Sidney emphasizes that freemen establish governments by consent, which aligns with Statement 2. However, Statement 1 alone, even in Sidney's framework, could refer to natural law, which is not a human constitution.

Second, the nature of the claims differs fundamentally: Statement 1 describes a trend of ecclesiastical encroachment on secular sovereignty, whereas Statement 2 involves the separation of powers between the Crown and Parliament within a national context. Even if popes asserted ultimate authority, it does not entail that a Chancellor's assertion undermines Commons' rights. Third, the authors' perspectives and contexts are unrelated: Argument 1 is from Jean Bodin's theoretical treatise on sovereignty, focusing on abstract definitions; Argument 2 is from a political speech during the Popish Plot, focused on practical parliamentary procedure.

Logical perspective: Statement 1 is a general claim about the necessity of sovereign powers for preventing disorder, while Statement 2 is a specific claim about an action undermining individual rights. There is no direct logical connection; the truth of Statement 1 does not necessitate the truth of Statement 2, as one could consistently hold that sovereign powers are essential for order while also believing that confiscating papers (if done by the sovereign) is a legitimate exercise of that power and does not undermine rights. Hence, no entailment.
2. Hobbesian perspective: In Argument 1, Hobbes argues that the sovereign's power is absolute, he cannot be accused of injury by subjects, and covenants made under fear are not binding against him. This implies that individual rights are subject to the sovereign's will. From this view, the sovereign's confiscation of papers would be within his rights and not an undermining of individual rights, contradicting Statement 2. Therefore, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 in Hobbes' framework.
3. Historical context: Argument 2 stems from the 1678 political climate where Whigs like Grey were concerned about arbitrary power and the erosion of due process, advocating for individual rights. Statement 1, derived from Hobbes' absolutist theory, was often invoked by Tories to support royal prerogative. These opposing ideologies mean that proponents of Statement 1 would likely reject Statement 2, seeing sovereign power as trumping individual rights to maintain order.

NO: The contexts of the two arguments show different emphases. Argument 1 uses Statement 1 to support the irrevocability of power transfer, focusing on the people's obligation to obey once they have transferred power. Argument 2 uses Statement 2 to argue for excluding a Catholic successor, focusing on the prince's duty to serve the people.

Thus, within their respective contexts, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. 3. YES: In early modern political thought, the relationship between ruler and subjects was often conceptualized as a pact or contract. If lawful pacts must be observed (Statement 1), and the ruler-subject pact implicitly or explicitly requires the ruler to consider the people's needs, then disregarding those needs would violate the pact. Hence, within that framework, Statement 1 entails Statement 2, as a prince who disregards the people's needs would be breaking the lawful pact that legitimizes his rule.","While there is a plausible connection in the context of social contract theory, the statements themselves do not have a strict logical entailment.

Evidence from Context 1 shows the prince as the lawgiver, not Parliament, so Statement 1 does not imply Statement 2.
2. NO: The historical contexts are vastly different. John of Salisbury's medieval concept of law is rooted in divine and natural law, whereas the 17th-century English Parliament is a human institution dealing with positive law. The principle that justice is interpreted through law does not automatically translate to respect for a particular parliamentary body, as law could be interpreted through other means, such as royal courts or ecclesiastical authorities.

2. Salmasius contends that true kings possess absolute power, including law-making, independent of popular consent.

Thus, logically, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.
2. Authorial perspective: Algernon Sidney, author of Argument 1, was a republican critic of absolute monarchy who argued that legitimate authority stems from the consent of the governed. His viewpoint would not automatically endorse supporting a king's specific actions, especially given the tensions during Charles II's reign. In fact, Sidney's emphasis on accountability suggests that Statement 1 might lead to scrutinizing royal policies rather than supporting them unconditionally, so Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.
3. Historical context: Argument 2 is set in 1678 during the Popish Plot and Exclusion Crisis, when Parliament was wary of Charles II's motives and the threat of Catholic influence. Statement 1 reflects Whig ideals that legitimacy comes from the people.

2. In the context of the provided arguments, Statement 2 appears as a premise or supporting idea that helps justify Statement 1. For example, in Argument 2, it is explicitly stated that the original purpose of forming societies was to ensure justice and protect individuals, and from this, the conclusion that it is lawful to punish a tyrant (similar to Statement 1) is drawn. This indicates that Statement 2 is used to support Statement 1, not that Statement 1 entails Statement 2. The direction of support is from Statement 2 to Statement 1, not vice versa.
3. Considering the authors' perspectives, both Brutus and Milton argue from the principle that political authority is derived from the people for their protection and welfare. However, the right to resist tyranny (Statement 1) is presented as a consequence of the breach of the trust placed in the ruler, not as a claim that itself implies the original purpose of societies. The authors assume the purpose of society as a given, but the statement about the right to resist does not logically require that specific purpose; it could be based on other principles such as natural self-defense. Therefore, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.","I am completely sure about my assessment because the lack of logical entailment is clear, and the contextual analysis reinforces that Statement 2 is a premise for Statement 1 rather than a consequence.

Generality vs. Specificity: Statement 1 makes a broad claim about governance effectiveness resulting from a commitment, whereas Statement 2 specifies a particular action (informing the king) and its effect. Entailment would require the specific action to be a necessary condition of the general outcome, which is not supported. 3. Disparate Mechanisms: Argument 1 emphasizes internal governance structures (oaths, councils) to enhance effectiveness, while Argument 2 deals with external affairs (alliances) and royal communication.

Even if coronation signifies public endorsement, it does not guarantee that the government will aim for the good of the governed.

The Glorious Revolution moved toward divided sovereignty (Crown-in-Parliament), contradicting indivisible sovereignty. Thus, the authors' perspectives do not support a logical connection. 3. Even if sovereignty is indivisible and vested in the Crown, Statement 2 does not necessarily follow because sovereignty includes the power to delegate functions like revenue management without surrendering ultimate authority.

NO: Statement 1 is a metaphysical claim about the source of authority, while Statement 2 is a normative claim about moral law; logically, they are distinct, and one could accept divine derivation without necessarily accepting scriptural commands for respect, as seen in Argument 1 where Suárez focuses on conditional obedience rather than explicit moral law. 3.

Thus, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2.
2. YES: Considering the context of Argument 1, Brutus argues that the ruler is bound by law for the benefit and safety of the subjects. The text emphasizes that subjects would not consent to arbitrary power, implying they have natural rights to life and security. Therefore, if the ruler is bound by law (as per Statement 1), it is to protect these inherent rights, which entails that citizens retain natural rights (Statement 2).
3. NO: Examining the authors' perspectives, Brutus (1579) writes from a resistance theory tradition focusing on limits on rulers, but does not explicitly articulate a theory of natural rights.

Strict logical perspective: Statement 1 is a general principle about political legitimacy (a ruler acting against interests undermines authority), while Statement 2 is a specific procedural claim about a legislative committee. There is no logical entailment because the truth of S1 does not necessitate the truth of S2; one can conceive a world where S1 holds but S2 is false (e.g., other mechanisms protect rights without a Grand Committee). Evidence: Locke's Argument 1 discusses resistance and dissolution of government, not specific legislative procedures like committees. Argument 2 focuses solely on a bill's dangers, not directly linking to the ruler's authority. Thus, S1 does not entail S2.
2. Contextual/thematic perspective: Both arguments touch on preventing governmental abuse, but S1 describes a consequence (undermining authority), while S2 prescribes a preventative measure (committee scrutiny). Entailment would require that S1 necessarily leads to the specific action in S2, which it does not. For instance, Locke's remedy for a ruler acting against interests is resistance or establishing a new legislative, not necessarily a Grand Committee. Historically, Argument 2 arises during Cromwell's rule, where the bill's powers might be seen as against interests, but S1 does not entail that committee scrutiny is essential; it could justify more radical responses. Hence, no entailment.
3. Historical and author perspective: Locke's Argument 1 (1689) is a philosophical justification for resistance after the Glorious Revolution. Argument 2 (1657) is a practical concern from a speaker during the Commonwealth. S1, derived from Locke, is a broad principle; S2 is a situational recommendation. Even if both aim to protect rights, S1 does not entail S2 because the essentiality of a Grand Committee is not a logical consequence of the principle that rulers undermine authority. Evidence: Locke's text emphasizes the people's right to alter government, not internal checks like committees.

Therefore, Statement 1, by affirming popular sovereignty, entails that any legitimate government must align with the people's will, which in that historical moment included protecting Parliament and Protestant faith. Answer 2 (NO): Statement 1 is specifically about the authority of the House of Commons in 1651 to condemn the king, deriving from the people's trust. Statement 2 is about ensuring a lifetime and hereditary monarchy in 1689. The goals of consolidating power in a constitutional framework are specific to the post-revolution settlement and not logically derived from the general principle of popular sovereignty. The contexts are distinct, and the latter includes religious protection not present in Statement 1. Answer 3 (NO): Milton's argument emphasizes that Parliament acts by supreme authority derived from the people, but it does not address the need for a constitutional framework that protects Protestant faith.

Contextual entailment: Both arguments emerge from 17th-century republican thought advocating popular sovereignty. Sidney's Argument 1 emphasizes the people's right to judge and remove corrupt magistrates, while Milton's Argument 2 rejects unchecked royal power. In this shared context, Statement 1's principle naturally entails Statement 2's specific application to kings. 3. Philosophical entailment: The concept of holding leaders accountable, as developed in early modern political theory, inherently involves leaders being answerable to the community they serve.

YES: Within the historical and philosophical context shared by Locke and Milton, the purpose of government to secure justice and property rights is fundamentally linked to representative institutions like Parliament; undermining them directly subverts that purpose and can be considered treasonous. Evidence: Milton explicitly argues that a king who undermines Parliament betrays the people's trust and commits treason, while Locke emphasizes that legislative authority derives from consent and must serve the public good. 3. NO: Entailment requires that Statement 2 necessarily follow from Statement 1, but conceivable governments could achieve the stated purpose without a Parliament, or without defining such actions as treason.

Statement 1 is derived from Marsilius of Padua's medieval treatise, which discusses the general relationship between prince and multitude in a civil order. Statement 2 arises from the specific Exclusion Crisis in 17th-century England, focusing on parliamentary privileges. The conceptual frameworks differ; Marsilius's 'multitude' is not equivalent to the 'Commons' as a legislative body, so the general obligation to maintain civil peace does not logically entail the specific action of rejecting a pardon justification.

2. Even if maintaining civil peace requires protecting liberties, Statement 1 does not specify the means to achieve it. In different circumstances, civil peace might be preserved through compromise or acceptance of certain measures, such as a pardon that could promote reconciliation. Thus, from the premise that the multitude must maintain civil peace, one cannot deduce that the Commons must reject the pardon justification; alternative courses of action might be consistent with civil peace.

3. Logical entailment requires that if Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 must be true in all possible worlds. Consider a scenario where the multitude maintains civil peace through other means, such as strengthening laws or increasing oversight, without addressing the pardon issue. The Commons might accept the pardon justification if it is believed to promote stability. Since it is possible for Statement 1 to hold while Statement 2 does not, there is no entailment.","The statements are from different eras and address different political constructs; while both value peace and liberties, the specific action in Statement 2 is not a necessary consequence of the general principle in Statement 1.

Accountable representatives could, after due deliberation, approve the funding if they judge it to be in the public interest, without violating accountability. 3.

Evidence from Argument 1 shows a focus on the virtues of rulers and the right to depose tyrants, with no mention of legislative procedures. 2. The historical contexts and authorial purposes differ significantly: Sidney's 1698 treatise is a theoretical work arguing against hereditary monarchy and for popular consent, using ancient examples, while Grey's 1678 speech is a practical intervention in the Popish Plot crisis, urging caution in parliamentary process. Thus, the principle in Statement 1, rooted in a different context, cannot directly entail the specific conclusion in Statement 2. Evidence from Context 2 highlights the immediate political tensions and specific legislative concerns. 3. However, both statements share an underlying concern for the public good: Statement 1 asserts that legitimate power depends on serving the common good, which implies that governmental actions should be taken carefully to avoid harm.

There is no direct logical connection that guarantees that collective responsibility entails the impossibility of over-restricting the king, as the latter involves a specific institutional mechanism not necessarily present in all systems described by Statement 1. 2. Statement 1 emphasizes collective responsibility to ensure representatives act in the people's interests, but it does not specify the extent of restriction on rulers. Statement 2 makes a strong claim that it is impossible to over-restrict the king via advisors. The populace might desire balanced restrictions, not unlimited ones. From Argument 1, Sidney acknowledges that delegates should not be overly fettered (e.g., 'the less we fetter them, the more we manifest our own Rights'), indicating that excessive restrictions can be counterproductive.

Sidney argues that governance through laws and popular oversight prevents tyranny, which aligns with the common good and likely leads to lasting government. Marsilius explicitly states that a principate governed by law endures because it avoids tyranny. Thus, if governance prevents tyranny (Statement 1), then a law-governed principate (a specific form of such governance) is more likely to endure (Statement 2). 2. YES: Historically, regimes that prevent tyranny are more stable and longer-lasting. Tyranny often incites rebellion and overthrow. Therefore, any governance that effectively prevents tyranny, such as a principate governed by law, inherently increases its chances of endurance. Statement 1 implies that governance serves to prevent tyranny, which in turn promotes endurance, supporting Statement 2. 3. NO: Statement 1 is a general claim about governance preventing tyranny but does not specify the form of governance. It could refer to democratic or mixed systems. Statement 2 is specifically about a principate (a monarchy) governed by law. The general claim does not logically entail the specific one; other forms of governance might prevent tyranny without being a principate. Moreover, endurance depends on factors beyond just preventing tyranny, such as external threats or economic stability, so preventing tyranny does not guarantee endurance.","While the arguments share themes of law preventing tyranny and promoting stability, Statement 1 is too broad to logically entail the more specific Statement 2.

Considering Hobbes' perspective in Argument 1, he argues that sovereign authority must be absolute and unchallenged to ensure peace. Any claim of divine authority that supersedes the sovereign's law would undermine this and threaten security. Thus, if monarchy promotes security (as per Statement 1), it necessarily requires the rejection of such divine authority claims, entailing Statement 2. 3. Within the specific historical context of Argument 2, the call to reject divine authority is tied to the Restoration period's unique tensions. However, Statement 1 is a general claim about monarchy.

The truth of Statement 1 does not necessitate the truth of Statement 2. 2. NO: The authors' perspectives and contexts differ significantly. Althusius (Argument 1) emphasizes mixed government with estates and councils, where the supreme magistrate is part of a collective decision-making process. Hobbes (Argument 2) argues for absolute sovereignty where laws are commands of the sovereign. The concept of 'supreme magistrate' in Althusius is not equivalent to Hobbes's 'sovereign,' and Althusius's council is not primarily a law-making body in the same sense as Hobbes's legislator. Therefore, from Althusius's argument, one cannot infer Hobbes's claim about fundamental laws. 3. YES: If the supreme magistrate is essential for directing universal councils, and such councils are responsible for deliberating on fundamental matters including laws (as Althusius describes, covering religion, war, peace, taxes, etc.), then the existence of such councils implies a role in law-making. Thus, if a Commonwealth includes universal councils directed by a supreme magistrate, it likely requires fundamental laws for those councils to address. However, this connection is contingent on the existence of universal councils, not directly entailed by Statement 1 alone.",The statements are derived from distinct political theories with different assumptions about sovereignty and governance.

Argument 2 addresses the specific political situation of 1689. Statement 1 could undermine the legitimacy of William III if he were considered a usurper, rather than entailing that he should rely on loyalty. The invalidity of usurpation does not directly imply a behavioral prescription for the king. 3. YES: From the perspective of political theory embedded in both arguments, Locke's emphasis on consent as the basis of legitimate governance suggests that a legitimate ruler should trust the loyalty of the people.

The historical and institutional differences mean principles do not transfer directly, so no entailment. 3. Thematic divergence: Statement 1 focuses on active opposition to royal authority, whereas Statement 2 emphasizes procedural caution to maintain a working relationship with the king.

Evidence: In Argument 2, Calvin acknowledges that appointed magistrates have a role to check tyranny, suggesting obedience is not an absolute derivative of divine origin alone. 2. Contextual disparity: The arguments have different purposes. Ockham uses the Apostle's declaration to argue for the independence of secular power from the papacy, not to establish a duty of obedience for private individuals. Calvin explicitly addresses the duties of private individuals and magistrates separately. Thus, within their respective contexts, S1 does not entail S2. Evidence: Argument 1 concludes that 'secular power is granted by God,' focusing on the source, not on subjects' obligations. 3. Historical and authorial perspectives: Ockham (14th century) and Calvin (16th century) wrote in different circumstances with distinct concerns. Ockham's citation supports imperial autonomy from the church, while Calvin's argument distinguishes between private obedience and official checks on tyranny.

YES: Both statements reflect a view that sovereign power is limited. Althusius's contract theory implies that the magistrate's authority is conditional and not absolute, which aligns with Milton's explicit denial of absolute power over the militia.

NO: The authority of the Great Council, as described, is specific to succession and regency matters, not a general legislative supremacy. Parliamentary sovereignty, as in Statement 2, is a broader constitutional principle about the supremacy of Parliament over all matters, including lawmaking. Thus, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. 3. YES: Both statements underscore the idea that collective bodies can override individual royal authority. From the authors' perspectives, both are arguing for the supremacy of representative institutions. Therefore, the demonstration of the Great Council's authority (Statement 1) supports the necessity of parliamentary sovereignty (Statement 2), and in that sense, entails it within the context of arguments for limited monarchy.","I am completely sure about my assessment because the two statements are rooted in distinct historical contexts and address different political concepts.

Reason 2: Statement 1 concerns the relationship between the sovereign and individual subjects, whereas Statement 2 concerns the queen, who is not necessarily the sovereign. In the context of Argument 2, the sovereign is the King, and the Queen is his consort. The statement about omitting the Queen's name does not directly relate to the sovereign's authority as described in Statement 1. Reason 3: Entailment requires that if Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 must be true. However, the truth of Statement 1 (that dissent against the sovereign is unjust) does not logically determine the practical outcome of omitting a name from a bill.

Evidence from Argument 1 shows Sidney argues that law rules the king, but he does not explicitly tie this to taxation powers. 2. YES: If we adopt Bodin's framework (Argument 2) where sovereignty includes law-making and taxation, and Statement 1 implies the king is not the law-maker (thus not sovereign), then it follows that only the sovereign authority (e.g., the people or legislature) can impose taxes, aligning with Statement 2. Evidence: Bodin states that the power to tax is 'part of the power of making law' and is an inalienable attribute of sovereignty. 3. NO: The arguments represent opposing views of sovereignty. Sidney's Argument 1 advocates popular sovereignty and rule of law, while Bodin's Argument 2 asserts absolute princely sovereignty. Statement 1, from Sidney's perspective, does not entail Bodin's claim about taxation exclusivity; instead, Sidney might hold that taxation is a power exercised by the people's representatives, not solely by a Bodinian sovereign.

In Argument 1, Salmasius defends the absolute power of the king, asserting that the king can dissolve Parliament at will as part of his supreme authority derived from God and heredity, not from the people's consent. Therefore, within this context, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2; in fact, it contradicts the idea that the people's authority is foundational. Evidence: Salmasius states that 'the king is above Parliament' and that the power to summon and dissolve lies solely with the king, emphasizing dominion without reference to popular consent.
2. In Argument 2, Milton argues that the people's consent is foundational to governance, but he does not claim that the king's power to dissolve Parliament is a necessary consequence of that foundation. Instead, he might view such power as potentially tyrannical and subject to popular oversight. Thus, even if the people's consent is foundational, it does not entail that the king has the ability to dissolve Parliament at will; conversely, the king having that ability does not entail that the people's consent is foundational. Evidence: Milton emphasizes that 'the people do not freely, and of choice, settle the Government in their King absolutely' and that power is given for specific ends, suggesting that royal powers are conditional, not inherent.
3. Logically, Statement 1 describes a specific institutional power, while Statement 2 describes a general principle of political legitimacy. One can conceive of a political system where the executive holds the power to dissolve the legislature (e.g., in certain constitutional monarchies or authoritarian regimes) without that power being derived from or legitimized by popular consent.

Even if accountability is inherent, it does not guarantee that any given transparency measure will foster trust; trust could depend on other factors. Evidence from Argument 1 shows accountability discussed in terms of tyrannicide, not institutional reports. Argument 2 focuses on transparency as a means to build trust, but this is not logically derived from the inherent nature of accountability.

Reason 2: The historical contexts and authorial perspectives differ significantly. Argument 1 comes from Juan de Mariana's 1598 treatise on tyrannicide within a monarchy, where accountability is enforced through popular rebellion or assassination. Argument 2 is from a 1657 speech in Burton, England, during the Commonwealth, focusing on governmental transparency to maintain public faith in a republican system. The different political environments mean that the concept of accountability is not directly transferable; thus, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 across these contexts.

Reason 3: The mechanisms of accountability in the two arguments are distinct. In Argument 1, accountability is realized through the threat of violent overthrow, which may not foster trust but rather fear. In Argument 2, the approach is procedural and aims to foster trust through transparency.

Reason 3 (Argument Analysis): In Argument 1, Locke grounds legitimacy in law and public good, permitting resistance to tyranny. In Argument 2, Maxwell bases authority on divine ordination. These foundations are incompatible; thus, Statement 1 does not lead to Statement 2's claim about divine institution.","The statements originate from conflicting philosophical traditions (Locke's social contract vs. Maxwell's divine right), and the definition of tyranny does not logically necessitate a divine origin for government.

Evidence from Argument 1 shows that Bodin advocates a range of actions including force, wise counsel, and humoring the people, not necessarily strict adherence to laws. Thus, Statement 1 does not logically entail Statement 2. Answer 2 (NO): The authors' perspectives are incompatible regarding the role of law. Bodin's sovereign has absolute power and can act above the law if necessary for stability, as seen in his discussion of using force against factions. The Whig speaker in Argument 2 insists on the supremacy of English law as a constraint on all authorities. Therefore, Statement 1 could be true while Statement 2 is false if the sovereign governs by decree. Answer 3 (YES): Both statements derive from concerns about political stability. If a sovereign must act decisively to maintain the commonwealth's well-being (Statement 1), then in any particular commonwealth, the sovereign should support institutions that promote stability. In England, as Argument 2 argues, relying on its own laws is essential for national stability.

The caution in Argument 2 (attributed to Grey) reflects a particular historical concern post-Glorious Revolution, not a logical consequence of Sidney's principle. 3. YES: Considering the shared historical context of late 17th-century England, both statements relate to the foundation of authority. If Statement 1 is true—that authority rests on laws rather than the king's will—then altering those laws could undermine that foundation, thus entailing the risk in Statement 2. Evidence: Argument 1 states 'the law makes the king,' and Argument 2 warns against changing laws that underpin governance.","While the statements are contextually related, entailment requires logical necessity. Statement 1 does not logically guarantee Statement 2, as the risk of destabilization depends on contingent factors, not on the mere fact that laws indicate a non-sole authority.

However, even if the emperor's jurisdiction is not upheld, the king of England could theoretically hold different views on papal exemption (e.g., based on other grounds), so necessity is absent. 3.

Statement 1 is about the just application of capital punishment to a king within an established legal system, which can be justified on various grounds (e.g., divine law, historical precedent) without presupposing a pre-political state of natural equality and liberty. Thus, S1 does not logically require S2. 2. The statements originate from authors with opposing ideological commitments. Maxwell uses S2 as a premise to deny popular sovereignty, while Milton's S1 relies on popular sovereignty but does not explicitly depend on the specific formulation of S2 regarding the state of nature. Milton focuses on the people's role in appointing and deposing kings, not necessarily on a theoretical community without government. 3. Entailment demands that S1 cannot be true if S2 is false. However, historical examples exist where kings were held accountable under law without any underlying belief in natural equality (e.g., feudal contracts or ancient constitutionalism). Hence, S1 can be true even if S2 is false, so no entailment.","I am confident that there is no entailment because the statements address different conceptual domains (applied justice vs. state of nature) and lack logical necessity.

NO: The contexts differ fundamentally—Locke’s theoretical principle of consent-based authority (1689) vs. a 1657 practical call for inclusive debate in a specific parliamentary situation. There is no direct logical link between the two statements. 3. YES: Both statements aim to uphold legitimate governance. Locke’s emphasis on consent implies that law-making should be representative, which aligns with including all relevant parties to ensure decisions reflect broad perspectives, thus Statement 1 entails Statement 2 in spirit.","While there is a possible conceptual connection via the principle of consent, the statements operate at different levels of abstraction and address distinct issues.

Statement 1 asserts that a prince should be held accountable, which implies that even the highest authority is subject to standards of justice. This aligns with Statement 2's principle that no one is above the law, as both reject immunity for those in power. Evidence from Argument 1 includes Mariana's justification for holding tyrants accountable, even through tyrannicide, while Argument 2 emphasizes that pardons should not override impeachment, reinforcing legal accountability.
2. YES: The historical contexts of both arguments involve challenges to absolute power and support for limitations on authority. Mariana's argument in the late 16th century questions divine right and upholds popular sovereignty, a concept that underpins the later English Parliamentary principle that no one is above the law. Evidence includes Mariana's discussion of the people's authority over the prince and the English speaker's focus on constitutional checks during the Exclusion Crisis.
3. NO: Statement 1 refers primarily to moral or natural law accountability, which may include extra-legal measures like tyrannicide, while Statement 2 emphasizes legal accountability within a specific constitutional framework. One can agree that a prince should be accountable to higher principles without endorsing a universal legal principle that applies to all individuals. Evidence: Mariana bases accountability on public fame and natural law, not formal legal processes, whereas Argument 2 centers on impeachment and pardons as legal mechanisms.","I am fairly confident that Statement 1 entails Statement 2 due to their shared core principle of ruler accountability, but nuances in the type of accountability (moral vs. legal) and historical contexts prevent absolute certainty.",3.0,YES

A general principle does not entail a specific historical outcome without additional assumptions. 2.

There is no necessary link between procedural accountability and religious unity; accountability could even deepen divisions in a fractured society. 3.

Evidence: Argument 1 focuses on the origin and purpose of power, not on transparency mechanisms. Argument 2 advocates naming but does not derive it from the rejection of divine right.
2. Historical and Contextual Differences: Sidney's work (1698) is a theoretical critique of divine right monarchy, written before the Glorious Revolution. Grey's speech (1689) is a practical response to the revolution, emphasizing clarity in political discourse. While both may align with Whig ideals, Statement 2 is not entailed by Statement 1; it addresses a specific situational need. Evidence: Sidney does not mention naming individuals; Grey does not base his argument on the denial of divine right but on immediate accountability concerns.
3. Alternative Mechanisms: Even if denying divine right implies accountability to the people, it does not necessitate the specific practice of naming individuals. Transparency could be achieved through other means (e.g., institutional checks, public records). Therefore, Statement 1 does not logically entail Statement 2.

Algernon Sidney's argument is about the evolution of parliamentary authority in a mixed monarchy, whereas James Harrington's argument is about designing a commonwealth with specific institutions to avoid monarchy.

From Locke's perspective, the sovereign's authority is derived from and limited by the consent of the governed. Therefore, the collective understanding of legality and morality stems from the social contract and natural law, not solely from the sovereign's decrees. Evidence: In Argument 1, Locke states that men unite by consent and the majority has the right to act, but he also argues that the government's power is for the protection of property and safety, implying a trust that can be revoked if the sovereign violates it. Second, the two statements originate from fundamentally different philosophical frameworks regarding human nature and the role of government. Hobbes (Argument 2) sees the sovereign as the absolute authority whose will defines law and morality, while Locke (Argument 1) sees government as a fiduciary power established by the people. Accepting Locke's view does not commit one to Hobbes's view; one can believe in voluntary union without believing that the sovereign's actions are pivotal in establishing morality. Evidence: Hobbes argues that crimes cease when sovereign power ceases, indicating that legality is entirely dependent on the sovereign. Locke, however, suggests that even without government, natural law exists, and individuals have rights. Third, in Locke's theory, the collective understanding of legality and morality is rooted in the law of nature, which is accessible to human reason, and the social contract institutionalizes these principles through majority rule. The sovereign (or government) is an agent of the people, not an independent source of moral authority. Thus, while the sovereign may enforce laws, the pivotal factor in establishing collective understanding is the consent and rational deliberation of the individuals, not the sovereign's actions per se. Evidence: Locke mentions that the law of nature and reason gives the majority the power of the whole, and that government is instituted to secure natural rights, not to create morality.","The two statements reflect distinct philosophical positions; Locke's emphasis on consent does not logically require that the sovereign's actions are pivotal in the Hobbesian sense.

The truth of Statement 1 does not necessitate the truth of Statement 2, as one could accept that divine appointment is flawed without markers while denying that regal power is fundamentally divine (e.g., if authority comes solely from the people). 2. From the context, Argument 1 (Marsilius) emphasizes human decision as the source of law and is skeptical of divine appointment without evidence, but it does not outright deny divine authority in all cases. Argument 2 (Suárez) affirms divine origin but through human mediation. The statements reflect these differing perspectives; Statement 1 does not logically imply Statement 2 because Marsilius's view does not require accepting Suárez's premise. 3. Entailment requires that if Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 must be true in all possible worlds. Consider a world where political authority is entirely secular and not attributed to divine authority at all. In such a world, Statement 1 could still be true (claims of divine appointment without markers would be flawed), but Statement 2 would be false.

There is no strict logical entailment because one could accept the harm of corruption while supporting alternative mechanisms like hereditary rule with checks and balances, as seen in some historical monarchies. 2. Contextual analysis: Both authors underscore the role of the people in governance. Sidney argues that the people create magistrates and must judge their performance, implying that authority originates from the people. This aligns with Cusa's view that election ensures rulers recognize their power comes from the governed, so within this shared framework, Statement 1 supports Statement 2 as a means to prevent corruption. 3. Authorial perspective: Sidney's Discourses focus on the right to remove corrupt leaders, not on initial selection methods, as evidenced by his emphasis on judgment and removal. Cusa's Concordance advocates election as a foundation for proper order, linking it to divine harmony.

Evidence: Argument 1 focuses on the human legislator as the elector, with no mention of individual legal defense rights, whereas Argument 2 focuses on specific injustices in parliamentary proceedings.
2. NO: The historical contexts and authors' perspectives differ significantly. Marsilius (1324) aims to curb papal power and establish secular authority based on the people, but his work does not address due process or guardianship issues like those in Grey's 1677 speech. Grey is concerned with immediate parliamentary abuses and individual rights in England. The principles in Statement 1, rooted in medieval political theory, do not entail the specific condemnation in Statement 2.
3. YES: Both statements share an underlying principle of accountable authority. Statement 1 insists that authority must align with the collective will, implying that all exercises of power should be legitimate and just. Statement 2 condemns an unjust exercise of power by a guardian. If authority derives from the community, then actions contrary to communal justice, such as denying the Duke a voice, are unacceptable. Evidence: Marsilius argues that no bishop or priest has coercive power without the legislator's authority, showing a theme of subjecting power to communal control. Grey's argument similarly seeks fairness in parliamentary proceedings, reflecting a shared norm against arbitrary power.","The statements address distinct domains (political legitimacy vs. individual due process), and while both oppose arbitrary power, there is no strict logical entailment.

NO: The historical contexts and authors' perspectives differ significantly.

In the historical context of anti-absolutist thought, Sidney and Locke both argued that rulers derive power from the people and must act for their benefit; therefore, the denial of true rulership in Statement 1 entails the loss of legitimacy in Statement 2. 3. However, there is a subtle distinction: Statement 1 focuses on the conceptual definition of a true ruler, while Statement 2 specifies a concrete consequence (forfeiture of legitimacy); one could accept the former without necessarily agreeing to the latter if they believe legitimacy is derived from other sources.","I am fairly confident because the arguments share a core philosophical foundation, but there is a slight difference in terminology and emphasis that prevents absolute certainty.",3.0,YES

Thus, NO. 2. Historical context: Argument 1 is from 1644, during the English Civil War, advocating for divine right of kings and against popular sovereignty. Argument 2 is from 1679, during the Exclusion Crisis, where loyalty to the Crown was often questioned. While both statements are pro-monarchy in tone, Statement 1 does not necessarily entail the specific loyalty claimed by the individual in Statement 2, as the individual's loyalty might be motivated by factors unrelated to the theory of sovereignty (e.g., religion, personal interest). Moreover, the individual in Argument 2 may hold views about the source of royal authority that conflict with Statement 1 (e.g., he might believe in some popular consent), yet still profess loyalty. Thus, NO. 3. Authors' perspectives: John Maxwell (Argument 1) would argue that kings derive power from God, not the people, and thus subjects owe absolute obedience. However, the speaker in Argument 2 is defending his own actions, and his loyalty might be conditional on the king upholding Protestantism or other values. Statement 1, by denying the legitimacy of contingent titles, would actually undermine the speaker's position if his loyalty is conditional. Therefore, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2; in fact, it might conflict with the kind of loyalty the speaker professes if that loyalty is not absolute.

Considering the authors' perspectives, Algernon Sidney (Argument 1) emphasizes the need for popular consent, while the speaker in Argument 2 emphasizes the need for legal accountability.

The truth of Statement 1 does not guarantee the truth of Statement 2, as one could consistently hold that dissent signals non-acceptance while still believing that some non-consensual power claims are legitimate (e.g., by divine right or conquest). Thus, there is no strict logical entailment.
2. Contextual analysis: Both statements derive from Algernon Sidney's arguments, which emphasize consent as foundational for legitimate government. However, Statement 1 is a specific observation about dissent and silent submission, while Statement 2 is a broader normative conclusion. In the arguments, Statement 1 supports the idea that consent must be explicit, but it does not by itself establish that all power without consent is flawed; that is argued separately with additional premises. Therefore, within the context, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 but rather complements it.
3. Philosophical perspective: Entailment requires that Statement 1 necessarily implies Statement 2. In political philosophy, one can accept that evident dissent reveals a disconnect between authority and the people's will without agreeing that consent is the sole criterion for legitimate power. For instance, a utilitarian might argue that a government's legitimacy stems from its effectiveness, not consent.

Argument 1 identifies factions and seditions as dangers, but the letter incident is not explicitly linked to faction formation. Without additional premises, Statement 1 does not logically entail Statement 2. 2. NO: The authors' perspectives differ significantly. Bodin (Argument 1) writes from an absolutist standpoint, emphasizing the sovereign's authority to suppress factions, which might include the king's prerogative to communicate with subjects regardless of parliamentary displeasure.

Therefore, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2; it might even contradict it. 3. YES: Considering the broader context, both statements address the need for stable governance.

NO: From the authors' perspectives, Sidney's Argument 1 advocates for balanced government but does not specify Parliament as the only means; it allows for various forms of mixed government. Milton's Argument 2 focuses on Parliament's role, but this is not entailed by the general premise about kingly corruption. Additional premises are needed to link the need for balance to Parliament specifically. 3.

Sidney's argument is part of a republican tradition emphasizing natural rights and resistance, while Aristotle's concern is with the best practical constitution. Natural liberty refers to freedom from constraint, not necessarily to comparative judgment. Evidence: Sidney's examples show people exercising their right but do not claim they are wiser than elites.

Thus, the threat posed by the Independents inherently implies the need to protect individual rights from state power, as both are linked to the erosion of traditional safeguards. 2.

A universal threat does not logically entail a specific response in a particular case.","I am fairly confident that Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 because logical entailment requires necessity, and S1 being true does not force S2 to be true; alternative means to address internal divisions exist.

Thus, the premise from Marsilius does not entail Locke's conclusion. 3.

NO: The determination of conflict with divine law in Statement 1 relies on external religious authority (Scripture, church teaching), not personal judgment. Statement 2 requires representatives to personally exercise judgment based on reason and debate. Evidence: Bossuet cites biblical passages (e.g., Romans 13) as the standard, while Argument 2 emphasizes parliamentary freedom and deliberation. YES: Both statements reject blind obedience. Statement 1 implies judgment is needed to discern when commands conflict with divine law, establishing a principle of scrutiny. This can be extended to political authority, entailing that representatives should exercise judgment. Evidence: The apostles' declaration 'We ought to obey God rather than men' (Proposition 2) shows judgment, and Argument 2's call for scrutiny aligns with critical evaluation.","While there is some interpretive overlap, the specific religious context of Statement 1 and the broader political principle of Statement 2 make logical entailment unlikely.

The truth of Statement 1 does not necessitate the truth of Statement 2, as they concern different aspects of political theory. 3. Counterexample possible: A society could rely on priests and kings to mediate the divine (making Statement 1 true) while having unelected principates or laws established independently of election (e.g., through hereditary rule or divine revelation), showing Statement 2 could be false.

Contextual analysis: The arguments come from different contexts—Spinoza's theoretical treatise and a speech on a specific historical crisis. The concepts are not interlinked; reverence is not discussed in Argument 2, and order/governance are not directly tied to reverence in Argument 1. Thus, within these contexts, Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2. 3. Authors' perspectives: Spinoza's philosophical perspective focuses on the rational foundations of political authority, while the speaker in Argument 2 is concerned with practical policy. Their differing aims mean a statement from one does not entail a statement from the other.","The statements are from distinct discourses with no direct logical connection, making entailment unlikely.

Evidence: Argument 1 focuses solely on the need for a common authority to prevent a state of nature, with no mention of ideologies. 2. YES: Within the historical contexts, both Marsilius and post-Glorious Revolution thinkers link order and progress to the stability provided by a common authority, and see divisive ideologies as direct threats to that authority. Thus, if a common authority is essential for order (Statement 1), then ideologies that undermine it jeopardize the resulting societal progress (Statement 2). Evidence: Marsilius argues against papal claims that disrupt secular order; Argument 2 warns against narratives that threaten the constitutional framework. 3. NO: The statements derive from distinct arguments with different immediate concerns; entailment would require an implicit premise that societal progress depends on order, which is not explicitly stated. Moreover, 'divisive ideologies' in Statement 2 is context-specific (e.g., absolutist sympathies), while Statement 1 is a general principle about political order.","I am fairly confident that Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 because the connection requires additional assumptions about the relationship between order and progress, and about the nature of divisive ideologies.

Statement 2 refers to Caesar, a pagan emperor. Acknowledging the authority of a Christian king does not entail acknowledging the authority of a pagan ruler. 3. Different Theological Premises: Maxwell's argument emphasizes divine right and non-resistance, while Dante's focuses on the independence of temporal power.

However, it does not logically entail the specific procedural necessity of comprehensive parliamentary debate during upheaval as stated in Statement 2. One could consistently hold that the public directs representatives through binding instructions or elections without requiring extended debate, especially in crises where swift action may be preferred. Evidence from Argument 1 shows that Sidney acknowledges the public may sometimes choose not to fetter delegates tightly, suggesting debate is not strictly necessitated. 2. NO: The statements derive from distinct arguments with different foci. Argument 1 concerns the philosophical foundation of political authority and delegation, while Argument 2 addresses legislative procedure in a specific historical context. There is no necessary connection: the truth of Statement 1 (a general principle) does not guarantee the truth of Statement 2 (a context-dependent claim about debate). Historical context shows that Grey's emphasis on debate responds to post-war tensions and the Test Act, not directly to the principle of public liberty. 3. YES: If the public must have liberty to direct representatives, then effective representation requires that diverse public views be thoroughly considered, particularly during upheaval when decisions are critical. Comprehensive debate in Parliament serves as a mechanism to ensure that direction is informed and representative. Argument 2 explicitly links rigorous debate to representing diverse views, which aligns with the public's liberty to direct representatives, as implied in Argument 1's emphasis on delegated power being accountable to the people.","I am fairly confident that Statement 1 does not entail Statement 2 because the relationship is not one of logical necessity but at best of plausible support.
